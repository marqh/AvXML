This document provides guidance on how abbreviations and codes from the Traditional Alphanumeric Codes (TAC)
are represented in XML (IWXXM).

==========================
METAR/SPECI
==========================
NIL (report)
  (Represented as a status of "MISSING" on METAR/SPECI and TAF reports)

CAVOK - Cloud and visibility OK
  When CAVOK conditions apply, the appropriate Record type shall have "cloudAndVisibilityOK" set to true and visibility,
  runway visual range, weather, and cloud information shall be missing.
  
CLRD - Runway contamination is cleared
  When runway contamination has been cleared, AerodromeRunwayState shall have "cleared" set to true
  
NSC - No clouds of operational significance
  When no cloud of operational significance is observed/forecast, and no restriction on vertical
  visibility and 'CAVOK' is not appropriate, the cloud group shall be missing with a nil reason of
  http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance

NCD - No clouds detected (by auto system)
  When no clouds are detected by the automatic observing system, it shall be indicated by a
  missing cloud group with a nil reason of http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notDetectedByAutoSystem

NOSIG - No significant changes are forecast
  When no change is expected to occur, this shall be indicated by a single missing trend forecast with a nil
  reason of http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/noSignificantChange

  The expected end of occurrence of weather phenomena shall be indicated by a change forecast with a missing weather
  group with a nil reason of http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance
  
R88 (runway designator for runway state)
  When all runways are being indicated, the AerodromeRunwayState shall have "allRunways" set to true

R99 (runway designator for runway state)
  When a new runway state report is not available in time for dissemination of the METAR message, the
  previous runway state report will be repeated

SNOCLO - Runway closed due to snow
  When a runway is closed due to snow, AerodromeRunwayState shall have "snowClosure" set to true

Present weather "//"

  system/sensor, the present weather shall be missing with a nil reason of
  http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable

Vertical visibility "VV///" (METAR/SPECI observations)
  When the sky is obscured and the value of the vertical visibility cannot be determined by the automatic observing
  system due to a temporary failure of the system/sensor, the vertical visibility shall be missing with a nil reason of
  http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable

Cloud amount and height "//////"
  When cumulonimbus clouds or towering cumulus clouds are detected by the automatic observing system and the
  cloud amount and the height of cloud base cannot be observed, this shall be indicated by a missing cloud layer
  with a nil reason of either http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable if the value could not be observed due to
  a sensor or system failure, or http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notDetectedByAutoSystem if the automated system is
  working properly but did not observe any values

Cloud amount "///015"
  When cumulonimbus clouds or towering cumulus clouds are detected by the automatic observing system and the
  cloud amount cannot be observed, this shall be indicated by a CloudLayer with a missing "amount" with a nil reason
  of either http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable if the value could not be observed due to
  a sensor or system failure, or http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notDetectedByAutoSystem if the automated system is
  working properly but did not observe any values

Cloud height "BKN///"
  When cumulonimbus clouds or towering cumulus clouds are detected by the automatic observing system and the height of
  cloud base cannot be observed, this shall be indicated by a CloudLayer with a missing "base" with a nil reason
  of either http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable if the value could not be observed due to
  a sensor or system failure, or http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notDetectedByAutoSystem if the automated system is
  working properly but did not observe any values

Cloud type "///"
  When cloud type cannot be observed by an auto system due to sensor limitations this shall be indicated by
  http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable.
  
Runway depth of deposit "//"
  When the runway depth of deposits is operationally insignificant or is not measurable this shall be indicated by
  a missing depthOfDeposits and a nilReason of either http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable or
  http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance.

Runway depth of deposit "99" (value from WMO code table 1079) 
  When the runway depth of deposits is not reported due to runway or runways non-operational due to snow, slush, ice, 
  large drifts or runway clearance this shall be indicated by a missing depthOfDeposits and a nilReason of  
  http://www.opengis.net/def/nil/OGC/0/unknown.
  


==========================
TAF
==========================
NIL (report)
  (Represented as a status of "MISSING" on METAR/SPECI and TAF reports)

CAVOK - Cloud and visibility OK
  When CAVOK conditions apply, the appropriate Record type shall have "cloudAndVisibilityOK" set to true and visibility,
  runway visual range, weather, and cloud information shall be missing.
  
NSC - No clouds of operational significance
  When no cloud of operational significance is observed/forecast, and 'CAVOK' is not appropriate, the cloud group shall be missing with a nil reason of
  http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance
  
NSW - No weather of operational significance
  The expected end of occurrence of weather phenomena shall be indicated by a change forecast with a missing weather
  group with a nil reason of http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance

Vertical visibility "VV///"
  When the vertical visibility is not available for any reason, vertical visibility shall be missing with no nil reason.
