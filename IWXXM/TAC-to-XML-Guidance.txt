==========================
This document provides guidance on how abbreviations and codes from the Traditional Alphanumeric Codes (TAC) are represented in XML (IWXXM).

==========================

NIL report
  NIL reports shall be represented as a status of "MISSING" on METAR/SPECI and TAF reports

Cloud amount "///015"
  When cumulonimbus clouds or towering cumulus clouds are detected by the automatic observing system and the cloud amount cannot be observed, this shall be indicated by a cloud "layer" with a nil "amount" and a nil reason of either "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable" if the value could not be observed due to a sensor or system failure, or "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notDetectedByAutoSystem" if the automated system is working properly but did not observe any values

Cloud base "BKN///"
  When cumulonimbus clouds or towering cumulus clouds are detected by the automatic observing system and the height of cloud base cannot be observed, this shall be indicated by a cloud "layer" with a nil "base" and a nil reason of either "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable" if the value could not be observed due to a sensor or system failure, or "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notDetectedByAutoSystem" if the automated system is working properly but did not observe any values

Cloud type "///"
  When cloud type cannot be observed by an auto system due to sensor limitations "cloudType" shall be nil with a nil reason of "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable"
  
Runway depth of deposit "//"
  When the runway depth of deposits is operationally insignificant or is not measurable this shall be indicated by a nil "depthOfDeposits" and a nil reason of either "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/notObservable" or "http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil/nothingOfOperationalSignificance"

Runway depth of deposit "99" (value from WMO code table 1079) 
  When the runway depth of deposits is not reported due to runway or runways non-operational due to snow, slush, ice, large drifts or runway clearance this shall be indicated by a nil "depthOfDeposits" and a nil reason of "http://www.opengis.net/def/nil/OGC/0/unknown"
  
==========================
